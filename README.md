#Minecraft-Web-Admin

Allows for the remote management of a vanilla Minecraft server.  This project currently supports authentication using passport.  Only users marked as administrators are able to access server controls.

I created this project to familiarize myself with React, Node.js, Mongoose / MongoDB, and websockets.
(...and also because a friend of mine is 10 years old and doesn't know how to use SSH to manage her Minecraft server)
